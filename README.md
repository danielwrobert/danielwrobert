Hello! I'm Dan and I'm a Front-End Engineer at [Automattic](https://automattic/com).

While I've worked in various parts of the company over the past several years, I currently work in the WooCommerce division as an engineering manager on the Store Editing the engineering team. There, I focus on the Full Site (Store) Editing efforts to bring a more modern editing experience to merchants.
